# cce105l-portcontainer
Port Container Management System

A Java-based simulation for managing port containers using ADT classes, a stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) data structures, and console-based input/output that demonstrates OOP concepts, ADTs, and basic user interaction.

What the project does:
- Represents containers and container operations using ADT classes.
- Uses two data structures (implemented in the Java source) to store and manage containers and ships.
- Lets you load, unload, and check the container and ship status through the console.
- Prints updated container details after each action.

Why the project is useful:
- Teaches key programming ideas: abstraction and data-structure use.
- Great for students, beginners, and instructors who prefer console programs.
- Easy to read and extend.
